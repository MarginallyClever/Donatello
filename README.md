![ workflow](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/NodeGraphCore/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

A pure Java implementation of [Flow-based Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) (FBP) and a GUI editor.

Data-flow programming is aesthetically pleasing, greatly reduces the chance of syntax error, and empowering for people
that are not fluent in the archaic syntax of text-only languages.

## Features

- Nodes are not directed or forced to run via triggers.  There is little danger of large networks overflowing the stack.  They could be run in parallel.
- Folding: Collapse a subgraph down to a single Node with *Fold* and reverse with *Unfold*
- The editor has written in Java Swing.  The main executable class is `com.marginallyclever.donatello.Donatello`.
- A ~/Donatello/ folder contains the application log file.
- A ~/Donatello/extensions/ folder contains 3rd party plugins.  Add new Nodes or write your own.
- While running the editor you can also access Swing-only nodes like `LoadImage` and `PrintImage`.  PrintImage results will appear in the background of the node editor panel.
- Convenient built-in nodes for basic math and reporting.
- Unit tests for everything!  If it can be tested, we shall!
