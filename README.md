## What is it?

Donatello is a Java-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for 
[Flow-Based Programming (FBP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming).
It offers a graphical interface that simplifies the creation and management of complex
data flows, making it accessible for both novice and experienced developers.

## Features

- No-code style programming with a graphical interface.
- Syntax errors are impossible to make.  The editor will not let you connect nodes in a way that doesn't make sense.
- Nodes can run in parallel using virtual threads (JEP 425).
